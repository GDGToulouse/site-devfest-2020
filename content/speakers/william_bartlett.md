Second generation developer, William had his first email account in 1990 at the age of 6 and fell into IT at the age of 10. On his journey across the universe of programming, he has roamed the superpowers of procedural and object-oriented where C, Python or Java are natively spoken. He has also embarked on several treks to the more exotic lands of the functional world, equipped only with a lambda and a few parentheses. His familiar is the penguin and his motto is “Use the right tool at the right time”.
