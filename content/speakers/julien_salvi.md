Into the Android world for almost 10 years (scary Eclipse dark time!), I experienced California startup way of life before coming back to France. I am currently a Senior Android Engineer at Aircall where we are building the best phone system for modern businesses. Alongside Android, I have a great interest in backend development with Kotlin and AR/VR technology. In 2021, I became an Android GDE to continue my journey to always share and learn with the Android community.
On my spare time, I am a world traveler and a beer lover always looking for the best IPAs!
