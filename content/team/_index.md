## DevFest Nantes is supported by GDG Nantes.

The [Google Developers Groups (GDGs)](http://developers.google.com/groups) are groups of people interested in Google Platforms and Technologies: Android, Chrome, Google Apps, Angular, Cloud... These groups promoting sharing can be found all around the world.

The objective of GDG Nantes is to organise events regularly:

- Google Technology Conferences and others on the Web, Cloud, Mobile, Big Data.
- Informal theme-based evening sessions around an Aperitif to facilitate meetings of similar minds and thoughts
- Codelabs to learn concretely and technically about technologies
- Competitions (Hackathon, ...)
- Video retransmissions of major events: US conferences, keynotes

To make all this possible, an awesome team of volunteers is working behind the scenes.
