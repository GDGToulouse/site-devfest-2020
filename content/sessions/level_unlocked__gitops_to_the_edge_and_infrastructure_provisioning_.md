Within its 7 years of existence, Kubernetes has been the centerpiece of the cloud native landscape, elevating a pluggable system that led to the diversification of the technology ecosystem. As a result, multiple areas have developed in the industry, galvanizing solutions for components that introduce standardization, guidelines, and interoperability of the tools. To innovate the developer experience and delivery of the application, the community focused on restructuring and modernizing the CI/CD operations. 

This talk will outline how cloud native GitOps tools, such as ArgoCD and Flux, unlock the zero-touch deployment of infrastructure and applications at the edge.  Attendees will acquire an understanding of GitOps usage in association with ClusterAPI for infrastructure provisioning and KubeEdge for the service propagation to the edge.
