## Reboot JS on the Server with Deno and Typescript

Announced when no one expected it, the Deno project appeared to be what we all wanted Node was: a secure, well-designed, TypeScript natively compatible, and modular runtime ready to power high-demanding applications in the modern Web Dev era.

There it is: Deno is now more and more in mind, and it's time to jump into the Deno train! This talk is a state-of-the-art tour of the technology: what Deno exactly is? How to use it to power a backend API for PWAs? What to expect in term of front-end revolutions?

A show with Demos, Code, Advanced use-cases, and Jokes: Spared no expense!
